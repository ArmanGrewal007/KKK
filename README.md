  <h1>Knights, Knaves and Kappas*</h1>

<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)">Kappas</a> are trickster spirits in Japanese folklore. Now, in some legegnds, they are helpful to humans, and in some they lure kids into water. So we have an air of ambiguity about them. In our context, Kappas represent an entity <b>that may tell the truth or may lie</b>. Completely unpredictable 🤷‍♂️ (I know not culturally appropriate, but <i>sounds cool</i>)</i>
